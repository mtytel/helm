/**
    Receives change event callbacks that are sent out by a ChangeBroadcaster.

    A ChangeBroadcaster keeps a set of listeners to which it broadcasts a message when
    the ChangeBroadcaster::sendChangeMessage() method is called. A subclass of
    ChangeListener is used to receive these callbacks.

    Note that the major difference between an ActionListener and a ChangeListener
    is that for a ChangeListener, multiple changes will be coalesced into fewer
    callbacks, but ActionListeners perform one callback for every event posted.
