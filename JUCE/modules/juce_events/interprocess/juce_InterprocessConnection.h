/**
    Manages a simple two-way messaging connection to another process, using either
    a socket or a named pipe as the transport medium.

    To connect to a waiting socket or an open pipe, use the connectToSocket() or
    connectToPipe() methods. If this succeeds, messages can be sent to the other end,
    and incoming messages will result in a callback via the messageReceived()
    method.

    To open a pipe and wait for another client to connect to it, use the createPipe()
    method.

    To act as a socket server and create connections for one or more client, see the
    InterprocessConnectionServer class.
