/**
    Encapsulates the logic required to implement a lock-free FIFO.

    This class handles the logic needed when building a single-reader, single-writer FIFO.

    It doesn't actually hold any data itself, but your FIFO class can use one of these to manage
    its position and status when reading or writing to it.

    To use it, you can call prepareToWrite() to determine the position within your own buffer that
    an incoming block of data should be stored, and prepareToRead() to find out when the next
    outgoing block should be read from.

    e.g.
    @code
    struct MyFifo
    {
        void addToFifo (const int* someData, int numItems)
        {
            int start1, size1, start2, size2;
            abstractFifo.prepareToWrite (numItems, start1, size1, start2, size2);

            if (size1 > 0)
                copySomeData (myBuffer + start1, someData, size1);

            if (size2 > 0)
                copySomeData (myBuffer + start2, someData + size1, size2);

            abstractFifo.finishedWrite (size1 + size2);
        }

        void readFromFifo (int* someData, int numItems)
        {
            int start1, size1, start2, size2;
            abstractFifo.prepareToRead (numItems, start1, size1, start2, size2);

            if (size1 > 0)
                copySomeData (someData, myBuffer + start1, size1);

            if (size2 > 0)
                copySomeData (someData + size1, myBuffer + start2, size2);

            abstractFifo.finishedRead (size1 + size2);
        }

        AbstractFifo abstractFifo { 1024 };
        int myBuffer[1024];
    };

        Because the section of data that you want to add to the buffer may overlap the end
        and wrap around to the start, two blocks within your buffer are returned, and you
        should copy your data into the first one, with any remaining data spilling over into
        the second.

        If the number of items you ask for is too large to fit within the buffer's free space, then
        blockSize1 + blockSize2 may add up to a lower value than numToWrite. If this happens, you
        may decide to keep waiting and re-trying the method until there's enough space available.

        After calling this method, if you choose to write your data into the blocks returned, you
        must call finishedWrite() to tell the FIFO how much data you actually added.

        e.g.
        @code
        void addToFifo (const int* someData, int numItems)

    void finishedWrite (int numWritten) noexcept;

    /** Returns the location within the buffer from which the next block of data should be read.

        Because the section of data that you want to read from the buffer may overlap the end

        After calling this method, if you choose to read the data, you must call finishedRead() to
