                                 for lengthy POST operations, so that you can provide user feedback.

                                 header directives, separated by newlines.

                                 is known, or 0 if a code isn't available
        @param numRedirectsToFollow specifies the number of redirects that will be followed before
                                 returning a response (ignored for Android which follows up to 5 redirects)
        @param httpRequestCmd    Specify which HTTP Request to use. If this is empty, then doPostRequest
                                 will determine the HTTP request.
