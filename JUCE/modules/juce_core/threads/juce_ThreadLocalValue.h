/**
    Provides cross-platform support for thread-local objects.

    This class holds an internal list of objects of the templated type, keeping
    an instance for each thread that requests one. The first time a thread attempts
    to access its value, an object is created and added to the list for that thread.

    Typically, you'll probably want to create a static instance of a ThreadLocalValue
    object, or hold one within a singleton.

    The templated class for your value must be a primitive type, or a simple POD struct.

    When a thread no longer needs to use its value, it can call releaseCurrentThreadStorage()
    to allow the storage to be re-used by another thread. If a thread exits without calling
    this method, the object storage will be left allocated until the ThreadLocalValue object
    is deleted.
