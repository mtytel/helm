    Encapsulates a thread.

    Subclasses derive from Thread and implement the run() method, in which they
    do their business. The thread can then be started with the startThread() method
    and controlled with various other methods.

    This class also contains some thread-related static methods, such
    as sleep(), yield(), getCurrentThreadId() etc.

        On Android, JUCE needs to be initialised once before it is used. The Projucer
        will automatically generate the necessary java code to do this. However, if

        JUCE intended for use in non-JUCE apks, then you must call this method
        manually once on apk startup.

        You can call this method from C++ or directly from java by calling the
        following java method:

        @code
        com.roli.juce.Java.initialiseJUCE (myContext);
        @endcode

        Note that the above java method is only available in Android Studio projects
        created by the Projucer. If you need to call this from another type of project
        then you need to add the following java file to
        your project:

        @code
        package com.roli.juce;

        public class Java
        {

        @param jniEnv   this is a pointer to JNI's JNIEnv variable. Any callback
                        from Java into C++ will have this passed in as it's first
                        parameter.
        @param jContext this is a jobject referring to your app/service/receiver/
                        provider's Context. JUCE needs this for many of it's internal
