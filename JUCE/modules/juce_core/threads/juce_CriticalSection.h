/**
    A re-entrant mutex.

    A CriticalSection acts as a re-entrant mutex object. The best way to lock and unlock
    one of these is by using RAII in the form of a local ScopedLock object - have a look
    through the codebase for many examples of how to do this.

    In almost all cases you'll want to declare your CriticalSection as a member variable.
    Occasionally you may want to declare one as a static variable, but in that case the usual
    C++ static object order-of-construction warnings should be heeded.
