/**
    This class acts as a pointer which will automatically become null if the object
    to which it points is deleted.

    To accomplish this, the source object needs to cooperate by performing a couple of simple tasks.
    It must embed a WeakReference::Master object, which stores a shared pointer object, and must clear
    this master pointer in its destructor.

    Note that WeakReference is not designed to be thread-safe, so if you're accessing it from
    different threads, you'll need to do your own locking around all uses of the pointer and
    the object it refers to.

    E.g.
    @code
    class MyObject
    {
    public:
        MyObject() {}

        ~MyObject()
        {
            // This will zero all the references - you need to call this in your destructor.
            masterReference.clear();
        }

    private:
        // You need to embed a variable of this type, with the name "masterReference" inside your object. If the
        // variable is not public, you should make your class a friend of WeakReference<MyObject> so that the
        // WeakReference class can access it.
        WeakReference<MyObject>::Master masterReference;
        friend class WeakReference<MyObject>;
    };

    OR: just use the handy JUCE_DECLARE_WEAK_REFERENCEABLE macro to do all this for you.

    // Here's an example of using a pointer..

    auto* n = new MyObject();
    WeakReference<MyObject> myObjectRef = n;

    auto pointer1 = myObjectRef.get();  // returns a valid pointer to 'n'
    delete n;
    auto pointer2 = myObjectRef.get();  // now returns nullptr
    @endcode
