/**
    Embedding an instance of this class inside another class can be used as a low-overhead
    way of detecting leaked instances.

    This class keeps an internal static count of the number of instances that are
    active, so that when the app is shutdown and the static destructors are called,
    it can check whether there are any left-over instances that may have been leaked.

    To use it, use the JUCE_LEAK_DETECTOR macro as a simple way to put one in your
    class declaration. Have a look through the juce codebase for examples, it's used
    in most of the classes.

                created.. That indicates that you're deleting some dangling pointers.

                Note that although this assertion will have been triggered during a destructor, it might
                not be this particular deletion that's at fault - the incorrect one may have happened
                at an earlier point in the program, and simply not been detected until now.

                Most errors like this are caused by using old-fashioned, non-RAII techniques for
                your object management. Tut, tut. Always, always use std::unique_ptrs, OwnedArrays,
                ReferenceCountedObjects, etc, and avoid the 'delete' operator at all costs!
