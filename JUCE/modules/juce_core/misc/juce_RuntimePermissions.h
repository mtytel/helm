/**
    Class to handle app runtime permissions for certain functionality on some platforms.

    The use of this class is currently only required if the app should run on
    Android API level 23 and higher.

    On lower API levels, the permissions are specified in the app manifest. On iOS,
    runtime permission requests are handled automatically by the Apple APIs and not
    manually in the app code. On Windows, OS X, and Linux, runtime permissions are not
    used at all. In all these cases, request() will simply call through to the
    callback with no overhead and pass true (making it safe to use on all platforms).

    For example, to enable audio recording on Android in your cross-platform app,
    you could modify your code as follows:

    Old code:

        audioDeviceManager.initialise (2, 2, nullptr, true, String(), nullptr);

    New code:

        RuntimePermissions::request (
            RuntimePermissions::audioRecording,
            [this] (bool wasGranted)
            {
                 if (! wasGranted)
                 {
                     // e.g. display an error or initialise with 0 input channels
                     return;
                 }

                 audioDeviceManager.initialise (2, 2, nullptr, true, String(), nullptr);
            }
        );

                           or denied; the argument passed will be true if the permission
                           has been granted and false otherwise.

        callback will be called immediately. The argument passed in will be true
        if the permission is granted or no permission is required on this platform,
        and false otherwise.

        If a runtime request is required to obtain the permission, the callback
        will be called asynchronously after the OS has granted or denied the requested
        permission (typically by displaying a dialog box to the user and waiting until
        the user has responded).

        via a previous runtime request or otherwise, or no permission is necessary.

        the permission can not be obtained at all at runtime.
