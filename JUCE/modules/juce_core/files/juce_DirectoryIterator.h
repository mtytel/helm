/**
    Searches through the files in a directory, returning each file that is found.

    A DirectoryIterator will search through a directory and its subdirectories using
    a wildcard filepattern match.

    If you may be scanning a large number of files, it's usually smarter to use this
    class than File::findChildFiles() because it allows you to stop at any time, rather
    than having to wait for the entire scan to finish before getting the results.

    Please note that the order in which files are returned is completely undefined!
    They'll arrive in whatever order the underlying OS calls provide them, which will
    depend on the filesystem and other factors. If you need a sorted list, you'll need
    to manually sort them using your preferred comparator after collecting the list.

    It also provides an estimate of its progress, using a (highly inaccurate!) algorithm.
