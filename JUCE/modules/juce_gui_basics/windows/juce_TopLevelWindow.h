/**
    A base class for top-level windows.

    This class is used for components that are considered a major part of your
    application - e.g. ResizableWindow, DocumentWindow, DialogWindow, AlertWindow,
    etc. Things like menus that pop up briefly aren't derived from it.

    A TopLevelWindow is probably on the desktop, but this isn't mandatory - it
    could itself be the child of another component.

    The class manages a list of all instances of top-level windows that are in use,
    and each one is also given the concept of being "active". The active window is
    one that is actively being used by the user. This isn't quite the same as the
    component with the keyboard focus, because there may be a popup menu or other
    temporary window which gets keyboard focus while the active top level window is
    unchanged.

    A top-level window also has an optional drop-shadow.
