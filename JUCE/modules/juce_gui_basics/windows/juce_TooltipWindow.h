/**
    A window that displays a pop-up tooltip when the mouse hovers over another component.

    To enable tooltips in your app, just create a single instance of a TooltipWindow
    object. Note that if you instantiate more than one instance of this class with the
    same parentComponent (even if both TooltipWindow's parentComponent is nil), you'll
    end up with multiple tooltips being shown! To avoid this use a SharedResourcePointer
    to instantiate the TooltipWindow only once.

    For audio plug-ins (which should not be opening native windows) it is better
    to add a TooltipWindow as a member variable to the editor and ensure that the
    editor is the parentComponent of your TooltipWindow. This will ensure that your
    TooltipWindow is scaled according to your editor and the DAWs scaling setting.

    The TooltipWindow object will then stay invisible, waiting until the mouse
    hovers for the specified length of time - it will then see if it's currently
    over a component which implements the TooltipClient interface, and if so,
    it will make itself visible to show the tooltip in the appropriate place.
