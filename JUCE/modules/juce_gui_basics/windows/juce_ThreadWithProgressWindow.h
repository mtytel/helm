/**
    A thread that automatically pops up a modal dialog box with a progress bar
    and cancel button while it's busy running.

    These are handy for performing some sort of task while giving the user feedback
    about how long there is to go, etc.

    E.g. @code
    class MyTask  : public ThreadWithProgressWindow
    {
    public:
        MyTask()    : ThreadWithProgressWindow ("busy...", true, true)
        {
        }

        void run()
        {
            for (int i = 0; i < thingsToDo; ++i)
            {
                // must check this as often as possible, because this is
                // how we know if the user's pressed 'cancel'
                if (threadShouldExit())
                    break;

                // this will update the progress bar on the dialog box
                setProgress (i / (double) thingsToDo);


                //   ... do the business here...
            }
        }
    };

    void doTheTask()
    {
        MyTask m;

        if (m.runThread())
        {
            // thread finished normally..
        }
        else
        {
            // user pressed the cancel button..
        }
    }
