/**
    A component that can be used as one of the items in a Toolbar.

    Each of the items on a toolbar must be a component derived from ToolbarItemComponent,
    and these objects are always created by a ToolbarItemFactory - see the ToolbarItemFactory
    class for further info about creating them.

    The ToolbarItemComponent class is actually a button, but can be used to hold non-button
    components too. To do this, set the value of isBeingUsedAsAButton to false when
    calling the constructor, and override contentAreaChanged(), in which you can position
    any sub-components you need to add.

    To add basic buttons without writing a special subclass, have a look at the
    ToolbarButton class.
