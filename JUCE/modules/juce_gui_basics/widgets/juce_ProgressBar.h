/**
    A progress bar component.

    To use this, just create one and make it visible. It'll run its own timer
    to keep an eye on a variable that you give it, and will automatically
    redraw itself when the variable changes.

    If using LookAndFeel_V4 a circular spinning progress bar will be drawn if
    the width and height of the ProgressBar are equal, otherwise the standard,
    linear ProgressBar will be drawn.

    For an easy way of running a background task with a dialog box showing its
    progress, see the ThreadWithProgressWindow class.
