/**
    One of these objects holds a list of all the commands your app can perform,
    and despatches these commands when needed.

    Application commands are a good way to trigger actions in your app, e.g. "Quit",
    "Copy", "Paste", etc. Menus, buttons and keypresses can all be given commands
    to invoke automatically, which means you don't have to handle the result of a menu
    or button click manually. Commands are despatched to ApplicationCommandTarget objects
    which can choose which events they want to handle.

    This architecture also allows for nested ApplicationCommandTargets, so that for example
    you could have two different objects, one inside the other, both of which can respond to
    a "delete" command. Depending on which one has focus, the command will be sent to the
    appropriate place, regardless of whether it was triggered by a menu, keypress or some other
    method.

    To set up your app to use commands, you'll need to do the following:

    - Create a global ApplicationCommandManager to hold the list of all possible
      commands. (This will also manage a set of key-mappings for them).

    - Make some of your UI components (or other objects) inherit from ApplicationCommandTarget.
      This allows the object to provide a list of commands that it can perform, and
      to handle them.

    - Register each type of command using ApplicationCommandManager::registerAllCommandsForTarget(),
      or ApplicationCommandManager::registerCommand().

    - If you want key-presses to trigger your commands, use the ApplicationCommandManager::getKeyMappings()
      method to access the key-mapper object, which you will need to register as a key-listener
      in whatever top-level component you're using. See the KeyPressMappingSet class for more help
      about setting this up.

    - Use methods such as PopupMenu::addCommandItem() or Button::setCommandToTrigger() to
      cause these commands to be invoked automatically.

    - Commands can be invoked directly by your code using ApplicationCommandManager::invokeDirectly().

    When a command is invoked, the ApplicationCommandManager will try to choose the best
    ApplicationCommandTarget to receive the specified command. To do this it will use the
    current keyboard focus to see which component might be interested, and will search the
    component hierarchy for those that also implement the ApplicationCommandTarget interface.
    If an ApplicationCommandTarget isn't interested in the command that is being invoked, then
    the next one in line will be tried (see the ApplicationCommandTarget::getNextCommandTarget()
    method), and so on until ApplicationCommandTarget::getNextCommandTarget() returns nullptr.
    At this point if the command still hasn't been performed, it will be passed to the current
    JUCEApplication object (which is itself an ApplicationCommandTarget).

    To exert some custom control over which ApplicationCommandTarget is chosen to invoke a command,
    you can override the ApplicationCommandManager::getFirstCommandTarget() method and choose
    the object yourself.
