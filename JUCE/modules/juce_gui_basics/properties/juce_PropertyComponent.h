/**
    A base class for a component that goes in a PropertyPanel and displays one of
    an item's properties.

    Subclasses of this are used to display a property in various forms, e.g. a
    ChoicePropertyComponent shows its value as a combo box; a SliderPropertyComponent
    shows its value as a slider; a TextPropertyComponent as a text box, etc.

    A subclass must implement the refresh() method which will be called to tell the
    component to update itself, and is also responsible for calling this it when the
    item that it refers to is changed.
