    This object watches for mouse-events happening within a component, and if
    the mouse remains still for long enough, triggers an event to indicate that
    it has become inactive.

    You'd use this for situations where e.g. you want to hide the mouse-cursor
    when the user's not actively using the mouse.

    After creating an instance of this, use addListener to get callbacks when
    the activity status changes.
