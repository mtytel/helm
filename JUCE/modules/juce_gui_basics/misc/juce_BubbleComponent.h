    A component for showing a message or other graphics inside a speech-bubble-shaped
    outline, pointing at a location on the screen.

    This is a base class that just draws and positions the bubble shape, but leaves
    the drawing of any content up to a subclass. See BubbleMessageComponent for a subclass
    that draws a text message.

    To use it, create your subclass, then either add it to a parent component or
    put it on the desktop with addToDesktop (0), use setPosition() to
    resize and position it, then make it visible.
