/**
    Models a 1-dimensional position that can be dragged around by the user, and which
    will then continue moving with a customisable physics behaviour when released.

    This is useful for things like scrollable views or objects that can be dragged and
    thrown around with the mouse/touch, and by writing your own behaviour class, you can
    customise the trajectory that it follows when released.

    The class uses its own Timer to continuously change its value when a drag ends, and
    Listener objects can be registered to receive callbacks whenever the value changes.

    The value is stored as a double, and can be used to represent whatever units you need.

    The template parameter Behaviour must be a class that implements various methods to
    return the physics of the value's movement - you can use the classes provided for this
    in the AnimatedPositionBehaviours namespace, or write your own custom behaviour.
