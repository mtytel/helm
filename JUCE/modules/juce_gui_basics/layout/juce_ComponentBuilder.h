    Loads and maintains a tree of Components from a ValueTree that represents them.

    To allow the state of a tree of components to be saved as a ValueTree and re-loaded,
    this class lets you register a set of type-handlers for the different components that
    are involved, and then uses these types to re-create a set of components from its
    stored state.

    Essentially, to use this, you need to create a ComponentBuilder with your ValueTree,
    then use registerTypeHandler() to give it a set of type handlers that can cope with
    all the items in your tree. Then you can call getComponent() to build the component.
    Once you've got the component you can either take it and delete the ComponentBuilder
    object, or if you keep the ComponentBuilder around, it'll monitor any changes in the
    ValueTree and automatically update the component to reflect these changes.

        this. If there's a problem and the component can't be created, this method returns nullptr.

        The component that is returned is owned by this ComponentBuilder, so you can put it inside
        your own parent components, but don't delete it! The ComponentBuilder will delete it automatically
        when the builder is destroyed. If you want to get a component that you can delete yourself,
        call createComponent() instead.

        The ComponentBuilder will update this component if any changes are made to the ValueTree, so if
        there's a chance that the tree might change, be careful not to keep any pointers to sub-components,
        as they may be changed or removed.
