        @param resizeButtonNowToFitThisImage        if true, the button will be immediately
                                                    resized to the same dimensions as the normal image
        @param rescaleImagesWhenButtonSizeChanges   if true, the image will be rescaled to fit the
                                                    button when the button's size changes
        @param preserveImageProportions             if true then any rescaling of the image to fit
                                                    the button will keep the image's x and y proportions
                                                    correct - i.e. it won't distort its shape, although
                                                    this might create gaps around the edges
        @param normalImage                          the image to use when the button is in its normal state.
                                                    button no longer needs it.
        @param imageOpacityWhenNormal               the opacity to use when drawing the normal image.
        @param overlayColourWhenNormal              an overlay colour to use to fill the alpha channel of the
                                                    normal image - if this colour is transparent, no overlay
                                                    will be drawn. The overlay will be drawn over the top of the
                                                    image, so you can basically add a solid or semi-transparent
                                                    colour to the image to brighten or darken it
        @param overImage                            the image to use when the mouse is over the button. If
                                                    you want to use the same image as was set in the normalImage
                                                    parameter, this value can be a null image.
        @param imageOpacityWhenOver                 the opacity to use when drawing the image when the mouse
                                                    is over the button
        @param overlayColourWhenOver                an overlay colour to use to fill the alpha channel of the
                                                    image when the mouse is over - if this colour is transparent,
                                                    no overlay will be drawn
        @param downImage                            an image to use when the button is pressed down. If set
                                                    to a null image, the 'over' image will be drawn instead (or the
                                                    normal image if there isn't an 'over' image either).
        @param imageOpacityWhenDown                 the opacity to use when drawing the image when the button
                                                    is pressed
        @param overlayColourWhenDown                an overlay colour to use to fill the alpha channel of the
                                                    image when the button is pressed down - if this colour is
                                                    transparent, no overlay will be drawn
        @param hitTestAlphaThreshold                if set to zero, the mouse is considered to be over the button
                                                    whenever it's inside the button's bounding rectangle. If
                                                    set to values higher than 0, the mouse will only be
                                                    considered to be over the image when the value of the
                                                    image's alpha channel at that position is greater than
                                                    this level.
