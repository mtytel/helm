/**
    An instance of this class is used to specify initialisation and shutdown
    code for the application.

    Any application that wants to run an event loop must declare a subclass of
    JUCEApplicationBase or JUCEApplication, and implement its various pure virtual
    methods.

    It then needs to use the START_JUCE_APPLICATION macro somewhere in a CPP file
    to declare an instance of this class and generate suitable platform-specific
    boilerplate code to launch the app.

    Note that this class is derived from JUCEApplicationBase, which contains most
    of the useful methods and functionality. This derived class is here simply as
    a convenient way to also inherit from an ApplicationCommandTarget, and to implement
    default versions of some of the pure virtual base class methods. But you can derive
    your app object directly from JUCEApplicationBase if you want to, and by doing so
    can avoid having a dependency on the juce_gui_basics module.

    e.g. @code
        class MyJUCEApp  : public JUCEApplication
        {
        public:
            MyJUCEApp()  {}
            ~MyJUCEApp() {}

            void initialise (const String& commandLine) override
            {
                myMainWindow.reset (new MyApplicationWindow());
                myMainWindow->setBounds (100, 100, 400, 500);
                myMainWindow->setVisible (true);
            }

            void shutdown() override
            {
                myMainWindow = nullptr;
            }

            const String getApplicationName() override
            {
                return "Super JUCE-o-matic";
            }

            const String getApplicationVersion() override
            {
                return "1.0";
            }

        private:
            std::unique_ptr<MyApplicationWindow> myMainWindow;
        };

        instead. For example, you might want to offer the user the chance to save
        their changes before quitting, and give them the chance to cancel.

        If you want to send a quit signal to your app, this is the correct method
        to call, because it means that requests that come from the system get handled
        in the same way as those from your own application code. So e.g. you'd
