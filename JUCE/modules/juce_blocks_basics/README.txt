
This is a JUCE module which discovers any connected BLOCKS devices and provides low-level
access to their physical properties.

Its job is to provide:
- topology and status information about the list of connected devices
- callbacks for touch events, control button presses and rotary dial movements
- simple control over individual LEDs
- optional rule-based virtual device aggregation functionality
