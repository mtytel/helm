/**
    A processing class performing multi-channel oversampling.

    It can be configured to do 2 times, 4 times, 8 times or 16 times oversampling
    using a multi-stage approach, either polyphase allpass IIR filters or FIR
    filters for the filtering, and reports successfully the latency added by the
    filter stages.

    The principle of oversampling is to increase the sample rate of a given
    non-linear process, to prevent it from creating aliasing. Oversampling works
    by upsampling N times the input signal, processing the upsampled signal
    with the increased internal sample rate, and downsampling the result to get
    back the original processing sample rate.

    Choose between FIR or IIR filtering depending on your needs in term of
    latency and phase distortion. With FIR filters, the phase is linear but the
    latency is maximised. With IIR filtering, the phase is compromised around the
    Nyquist frequency but the latency is minimised.
