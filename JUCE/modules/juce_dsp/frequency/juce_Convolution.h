/**
    Performs stereo uniform-partitioned convolution of an input signal with an
    impulse response in the frequency domain, using the juce FFT class.

    It provides some thread-safe functions to load impulse responses as well,
    from audio files or memory on the fly without any noticeable artefacts,
    performing resampling and trimming if necessary.

    The processing is equivalent to the time domain convolution done in the
    class FIRFilter, with a FIRFilter::Coefficients object having as
    coefficients the samples of the impulse response. However, it is more
    efficient in general to do frequency domain convolution when the size of
    the impulse response is higher than 64 samples.
