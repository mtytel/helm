/**
    Performs a fast fourier transform.

    This is only a simple low-footprint implementation and isn't tuned for speed - it may
    be useful for simple applications where one of the more complex FFT libraries would be
    overkill. (But in the future it may end up becoming optimised of course...)

    The FFT class itself contains lookup tables, so there's some overhead in creating
    one, you should create and cache an FFT object for each size/direction of transform
    that you need, and re-use them to perform the actual operation.

        As the coefficients of the negative frequencies (frequencies higher than
        N/2 or pi) are the complex conjugate of their positive counterparts,
        it may not be necessary to calculate them for your particular application.
        You can use dontCalculateNegativeFrequencies to let the FFT
        engine know that you do not plan on using them. Note that this is only a
        hint: some FFT engines (currently only the Fallback engine), will still
        calculate the negative frequencies even if dontCalculateNegativeFrequencies
        is true.

        The size of the array passed in must be 2 * getSize(), and the first half
        should contain your raw input sample data. On return, if
        dontCalculateNegativeFrequencies is false, the array will contain size
        complex real + imaginary parts data interleaved. If
        dontCalculateNegativeFrequencies is true, the array will contain at least
        (size / 2) + 1 complex numbers. Both outputs can be passed to
        performRealOnlyInverseTransform() in order to convert it back to reals.
