                                    If the format is fixed-point, each channel will be written
                                    as an array of 32-bit signed integers using the full
                                    range -0x80000000 to 0x7fffffff, regardless of the source's
                                    bit-depth. If it is a floating-point format, you should cast
                                    the resulting array to a (float**) to get the values (in the
                                    range -1.0 to 1.0 or beyond)
                                    If the format is stereo, then destChannels[0] is the left channel
                                    data, and destChannels[1] is the right channel.
                                    The numDestChannels parameter indicates how many pointers this array
                                    contains, but some of these pointers can be null if you don't want to

                                    for some of the channels that you pass in, then they should be filled with
                                    copies of valid source channels.
                                    E.g. if you're reading a mono file and you pass 2 channels to this method, then
                                    if fillLeftoverChannelsWithCopies is true, both destination channels will be filled
                                    with the same data from the file's single channel. If fillLeftoverChannelsWithCopies
                                    was false, then only the first channel would be filled with the file's contents, and
                                    the second would be cleared. If there are many channels, e.g. you try to read 4 channels
                                    from a stereo file, then the last 3 would all end up with copies of the same data.
        @returns                    true if the operation succeeded, false if there was an error. Note
                                    that reading sections of data beyond the extent of the stream isn't an
