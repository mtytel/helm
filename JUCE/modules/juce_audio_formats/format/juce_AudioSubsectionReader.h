    This class is used to wrap an AudioFormatReader and only read from a
    subsection of the file.

    So if you have a reader which can read a 1000 sample file, you could wrap it
    in one of these to only access, e.g. samples 100 to 200, and any samples
    outside that will come back as 0. Accessing sample 0 from this reader will
    actually read the first sample from the other's subsection, which might
    be at a non-zero position.
