/**
    A base class for dispatching analytics events on a dedicated thread.

    This class is particularly useful for sending analytics events to a web
    server without blocking the message thread. It can also save (and restore)
    events that were not dispatched so no information is lost when an internet
    connection is absent or something else prevents successful logging.

    Once startAnalyticsThread is called the logBatchedEvents method is
    periodically invoked on an analytics thread, with the period determined by
    calls to setBatchPeriod. Here events are grouped together into batches, with
    the maximum batch size set by the implementation of getMaximumBatchSize.

    It's important to call stopAnalyticsThread in the destructor of your
    subclass (or before then) to give the analytics thread time to shut down.
    Calling stopAnalyticsThread will, in turn, call stopLoggingEvents, which
    you should use to terminate the currently running logBatchedEvents call.
