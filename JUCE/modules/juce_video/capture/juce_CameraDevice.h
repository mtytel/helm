    Controls any video capture devices that might be available.

        to open.

        The size constraints allow the method to choose between different resolutions if
        the camera supports this. If the resolution can't be specified (e.g. on the Mac)
        then these will be ignored.

        On Mac, if highQuality is false, then the camera will be opened in preview mode
        which will allow the OS to drop frames if the computer cannot keep up in processing
        the frames.

        resultCallback will be invoked with valid CameraDevice* and an empty error
        String on success, or nullptr CameraDevice and a non-empty error String on failure.

        This is the preferred method of opening a camera device, because it works on all
        platforms, whereas synchronous openDevice() does not work on iOS & Android.

        On iOS, if you want to switch a device, it is more efficient to open a new device
        before closing the older one, because this way both devices can share the same
        underlying camera session. Otherwise, the session needs to be close first, and this
        is a lengthy process that can take several seconds.

        The Android implementation currently supports a maximum recording resolution of
        1080p. Choosing a larger size will result in larger pictures taken, but the video
        will be capped at 1080p.
