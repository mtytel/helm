    /** Plays the sound from a positionable audio source.

        This will output the sound coming from a positionable audio source.
        This gives you slightly more control over the sound playback compared
        to  the other playSound methods. For example, if you would like to
        stop the sound prematurely you can call this method with a
        TransportAudioSource and then call audioSource->stop. Note that,
        you must call audioSource->start to start the playback, if your
        audioSource is a TransportAudioSource.

        The audio device manager will not hold any references to this audio
        source once the audio source has stopped playing for any reason,
        for example when the sound has finished playing or when you have
        called audioSource->stop. Therefore, calling audioSource->start() on
        a finished audioSource will not restart the sound again. If this is
        desired simply call playSound with the same audioSource again.

        @param audioSource   the audio source to play
        @param deleteWhenFinished If this is true then the audio source will
                                  be deleted once the device manager has finished
                                  playing.
        @param sampleRateOfSource The sample rate of the source. If this is zero, JUCE
                                  will assume that the sample rate is the same as the
                                  audio output device.

        than buffer channels, then the ones that are available will be re-used on
