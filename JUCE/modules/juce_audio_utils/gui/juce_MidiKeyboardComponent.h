/**
    A component that displays a piano keyboard, whose notes can be clicked on.

    This component will mimic a physical midi keyboard, showing the current state of
    a MidiKeyboardState object. When the on-screen keys are clicked on, it will play these
    notes by calling the noteOn() and noteOff() methods of its MidiKeyboardState object.

    Another feature is that the computer keyboard can also be used to play notes. By
    default it maps the top two rows of a standard qwerty keyboard to the notes, but
    these can be remapped if needed. It will only respond to keypresses when it has
    the keyboard focus, so to disable this feature you can call setWantsKeyboardFocus (false).

    The component is also a ChangeBroadcaster, so if you want to be informed when the
    keyboard is scrolled, you can register a ChangeListener for callbacks.
