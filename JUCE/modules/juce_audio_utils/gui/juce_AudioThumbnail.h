/**
    Makes it easy to quickly draw scaled views of the waveform shape of an
    audio file.

    To use this class, just create an AudioThumbNail class for the file you want
    to draw, call setSource to tell it which file or resource to use, then call
    drawChannel() to draw it.

    The class will asynchronously scan the wavefile to create its scaled-down view,
    so you should make your UI repaint itself as this data comes in. To do this, the
    AudioThumbnail is a ChangeBroadcaster, and will broadcast a message when its
    listeners should repaint themselves.

    The thumbnail stores an internal low-res version of the wave data, and this can
    be loaded and saved to avoid having to scan the file again.
