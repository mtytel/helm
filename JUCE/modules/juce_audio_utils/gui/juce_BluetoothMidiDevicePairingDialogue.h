/**
    Opens a Bluetooth MIDI pairing dialogue that allows the user to view and
    connect to Bluetooth MIDI devices that are currently found nearby.

    The dialogue will ignore non-MIDI Bluetooth devices.

    Only after a Bluetooth MIDI device has been paired will its MIDI ports
    be available through JUCE's MidiInput and MidiOutput classes.

    This dialogue is currently only available on macOS targetting versions 10.11+,
    iOS and Android. When targeting older versions of macOS you should instead
    pair Bluetooth MIDI devices using the "Audio MIDI Setup" app (located in
    /Applications/Utilities). On Windows, you should use the system settings. On
    Linux, Bluetooth MIDI devices are currently not supported.
