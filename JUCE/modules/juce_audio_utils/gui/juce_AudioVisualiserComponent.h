/**
    A simple component that can be used to show a scrolling waveform of audio data.

    This is a handy way to get a quick visualisation of some audio data. Just create
    one of these, set its size and oversampling rate, and then feed it with incoming
    data by calling one of its pushBuffer() or pushSample() methods.

    You can override its paint method for more customised views, but it's only designed
    as a quick-and-dirty class for simple tasks, so please don't send us feature requests
    for fancy additional features that you'd like it to support! If you're building a
    real-world app that requires more powerful waveform display, you'll probably want to
    create your own component instead.
