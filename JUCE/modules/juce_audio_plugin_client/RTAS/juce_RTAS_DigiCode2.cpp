/*
    This file is used to include and build the required digidesign CPP files without your project
    needing to reference the files directly. Because these files will be found via your include path,
    this means that the project doesn't have to change to cope with people's SDKs being in different
    locations.

    Important note on Windows: In your project settings for the three juce_RTAS_DigiCode.cpp files and
    the juce_RTAS_Wrapper.cpp file, you need to set the calling convention to "__stdcall".
    If you don't do this, you'll get some unresolved externals and will spend a long time wondering what's
    going on... All the other files in your project can be set to use the normal __cdecl convention.

    If you get an error building the includes statements below, check your paths - there's a full
    list of the necessary Digidesign paths in juce_RTAS_Wrapper.cpp
