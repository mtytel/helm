/**
    The juce_product_unlocking module provides simple user-registration classes
    for allowing you to build apps/plugins with features that are unlocked by a
    user having a suitable account on a webserver.

    Although originally designed for use with products that are sold on the
    Tracktion Marketplace web-store, the module itself is fully open, and can
    be used to connect to your own web-store instead, if you implement your
    own compatible web-server back-end.

    In additional, the module supports in-app purchases both on iOS and Android
    platforms.
