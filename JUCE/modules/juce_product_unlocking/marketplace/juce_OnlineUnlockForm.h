/** Acts as a GUI which asks the user for their details, and calls the appropriate
    methods on your OnlineUnlockStatus object to attempt to register the app.

    You should create one of these components and add it to your parent window,
    or use a DialogWindow to display it as a pop-up. But if you're writing a plugin,
    then DO NOT USE A DIALOG WINDOW! Add it as a child component of your plugin's editor
    component instead. Plugins that pop up external registration windows are incredibly
    annoying, and cause all sorts of headaches for hosts. Don't be the person who
    writes that plugin that irritates everyone with a dialog box every time they
    try to scan for new plugins!

    Note that after adding it, you should put the component into a modal state,
    and it will automatically delete itself when it has completed.

    Although it deletes itself, it's also OK to delete it manually yourself
    if you need to get rid of it sooner.
