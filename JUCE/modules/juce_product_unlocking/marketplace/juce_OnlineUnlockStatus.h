/**
    A base class for online unlocking systems.

    This class stores information about whether your app has been unlocked for the
    current machine, and handles communication with a web-store to perform the
    unlock procedure.

    You probably won't ever use this base class directly, but rather a store-specific
    subclass such as TracktionMarketplaceStatus, which knows how to talk to the particular
    online store that you're using.

    To use it, you create a subclass which implements all the pure virtual methods
    (see their comments to find out what you'll need to make them do).

    Then you can create an instance of your subclass which will hold the registration
    state. Typically, you'll want to just keep a single instance of the class around for
    the duration of your app. You can then call its methods to handle the various
    registration tasks.

    Areas of your code that need to know whether the user is registered (e.g. to decide
    whether a particular feature is available) should call isUnlocked() to find out.

    If you want to create a GUI that allows your users to enter their details and
    register, see the OnlineUnlockForm class.
