    A graphical effect filter that can be applied to components.

    An ImageEffectFilter can be applied to the image that a component
    paints before it hits the screen.

    This is used for adding effects like shadows, blurs, etc.

        The implementation of this method must use the image that is passed in
        as its source, and should render its output to the graphics context passed in.

        @param sourceImage      the image that the source component has just rendered with

                                channel, depending on whether the component is opaque.
        @param destContext      the graphics context to use to draw the resultant image.
        @param scaleFactor      a scale factor that has been applied to the image - e.g. if
                                this is 2, then the image is actually scaled-up to twice the
                                original resolution
