/**
    An OSC time tag.

    OSC time tags are part of OSCBundle objects.

    In accordance with the OSC 1.0 specification, the internal timestamp stored in
    OSCTimeTag uses the same binary format as NTP timestamps. The representation
    is by a 64 bit fixed point number. The first 32 bits specify the number of
    seconds since midnight on January 1, 1900, and the last 32 bits specify
    fractional parts of a second to a precision of about 200 picoseconds.

    The time tag value consisting of 63 zero bits followed by a one in the least
    significant bit is a special case meaning "immediately".

    For a more user-friendly time format, convert OSCTimeTag to a juce::Time object
    using toTime().
