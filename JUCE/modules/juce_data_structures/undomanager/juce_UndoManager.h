/**
    Manages a list of undo/redo commands.

    An UndoManager object keeps a list of past actions and can use these actions
    to move backwards and forwards through an undo history.

    To use it, create subclasses of UndoableAction which perform all the
    actions you need, then when you need to actually perform an action, create one
    and pass it to the UndoManager's perform() method.

    The manager also uses the concept of 'transactions' to group the actions
    together - all actions performed between calls to beginNewTransaction() are
    grouped together and are all undone/redone as a group.

    The UndoManager is a ChangeBroadcaster, so listeners can register to be told
    when actions are performed or undone.
