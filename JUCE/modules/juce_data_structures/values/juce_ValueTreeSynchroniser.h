/**
    This class can be used to watch for all changes to the state of a ValueTree,
    and to convert them to a transmittable binary encoding.

    The purpose of this class is to allow two or more ValueTrees to be remotely
    synchronised by transmitting encoded changes over some kind of transport
    mechanism.

    To use it, you'll need to implement a subclass of ValueTreeSynchroniser
    and implement the stateChanged() method to transmit the encoded change (maybe
    via a network or other means) to a remote destination, where it can be
    applied to a target tree.
