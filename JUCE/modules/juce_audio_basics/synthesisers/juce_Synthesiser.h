/**
    Base class for a musical device that can play sounds.

    To create a synthesiser, you'll need to create a subclass of SynthesiserSound
    to describe each sound available to your synth, and a subclass of SynthesiserVoice
    which can play back one of these sounds.

    Then you can use the addVoice() and addSound() methods to give the synthesiser a
    set of sounds, and a set of voices it can use to play them. If you only give it
    one voice it will be monophonic - the more voices it has, the more polyphony it'll
    have available.

    Then repeatedly call the renderNextBlock() method to produce the audio. Any midi
    events that go in will be scanned for note on/off messages, and these are used to
    start and stop the voices playing the appropriate sounds.

    While it's playing, you can also cause notes to be triggered by calling the noteOn(),
    noteOff() and other controller methods.

    Before rendering, be sure to call the setCurrentPlaybackSampleRate() to tell it
    what the target playback rate is. This value is passed on to the voices so that
    they can pitch their output correctly.

        renderVoices() could be called once per sample and lead to poor performance, so this
        setting allows you to set a lower limit on the block size.

        accuracy, which is probably fine for most purposes, but you may want to increase or
        decrease this value for your synth.

        If shouldBeStrict is true, the audio sub-blocks will strictly never be smaller than numSamples.

        If shouldBeStrict is false (default), the first audio sub-block in the buffer is allowed
        to be smaller, to make sure that the first MIDI event in a buffer will always be sample-accurate
        (this can sometimes help to avoid quantisation or phasing issues).
