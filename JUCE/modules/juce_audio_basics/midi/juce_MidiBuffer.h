    Holds a sequence of time-stamped midi events.

    Analogous to the AudioBuffer, this holds a set of midi events with
    integer time-stamps. The buffer is kept sorted in order of the time-stamps.

    If you're working with a sequence of midi events that may need to be manipulated
    or read/written to a midi file, then MidiMessageSequence is probably a more
    appropriate container. MidiBuffer is designed for lower-level streams of raw
    midi data.
