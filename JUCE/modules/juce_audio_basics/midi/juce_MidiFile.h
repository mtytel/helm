    Reads/writes standard midi format files.

    To read a midi file, create a MidiFile object and call its readFrom() method. You
    can then get the individual midi tracks from it using the getTrack() method.

    To write a file, create a MidiFile object, add some MidiMessageSequence objects
    to it using the addTrack() method, and then call its writeTo() method to stream
    it out.
