/**
    A class to take care of the logic involved with the loading/saving of some kind
    of document.

    There's quite a lot of tedious logic involved in writing all the load/save/save-as
    functions you need for documents that get saved to a file, so this class attempts
    to abstract most of the boring stuff.

    Your subclass should just implement all the pure virtual methods, and you can
    then use the higher-level public methods to do the load/save dialogs, to warn the user
    about overwriting files, etc.

    The document object keeps track of whether it has changed since it was last saved or
    loaded, so when you change something, call its changed() method. This will set a
    flag so it knows it needs saving, and will also broadcast a change message using the
    ChangeBroadcaster base class.
